**Student:** Brian Cox 
**Date:** 10-26-2025
## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to build repositories and collaborate.
- Allows collaborators to work independently on issues to solve a larger topic.
- To help others understand what you are doing or working on.

## Challenges and Solutions
[Describe 1-2 challenges you faced and how you overcame them. Examples: creating folders in GitHub, understanding the two-repository workflow, writing markdown]

## Connection to My GIS Career
[Explain in 2-3 sentences how GitHub skills will help you in your GIS career. Think about portfolio building, collaboration, contributing to open source projects]

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
